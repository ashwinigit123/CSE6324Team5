Domain based clustering of SIMULINK dataset.
Searching for projects or code on web is the most common activity we perform as students. 
When facing a problem, we go to google and type in the keywords we want to search for, incase if we want to look for any previously implemented projects, we try finding it on GitHub.
Currently Search on GitHub works on finding all relevant projects based on the matching the search keyword.
We want to improve this standard search by clustering the projects together based on their domain or category they belong to. 
The user will enter the domain he/she is interested in, and our system will try to group together similar projects based on the domain specified by the user.
We will explore on how GitHub search works currently, what clustering algorithms we can use to maximize/optimize our search result.
